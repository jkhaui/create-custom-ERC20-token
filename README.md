# create-custom-ERC20-token
Easily create your own token on Remix (http://remix.ethereum.org).

While this code leverages the Open Zeppelin library (and includes the safe math module to follow best practice), I've "flattened" the libraries into one file, as this is a requirement if you're trying to verify your source code on Etherscan.
